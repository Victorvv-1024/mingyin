## 🚀 How to Use the Refactored Code

### Setup Environment
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sales_forecasting

# Or use pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.data.loader import SalesDataLoader
from src.data.preprocessing import SalesPreprocessor
from src.data.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer
from src.config.config import get_config

# Load configuration
config = get_config()

# Load and process data
loader = SalesDataLoader()
preprocessor = SalesPreprocessor()
engineer = FeatureEngineer()

# Process pipeline
raw_data = loader.load_excel_data(years=[2021, 2022])
clean_data, quality_report = preprocessor.process(raw_data)
engineered_data, features, splits = engineer.create_all_features(clean_data)
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python scripts/demo.py
```
