## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### **Training Efficiency Comparison**

| Aspect | Vanilla Model | Enhanced Model |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Model Parameters** | ~620K | ~620K |
| **Architecture** | Standard embedding + attention | Multi-head attention + residual |
| **Training Time** | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| **Epochs to Convergence** | 1-3 | 20-40 |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower | Higher |
| **Complexity** | Simple, interpretable | Complex, harder to debug |

### **Performance Stability**

**Vanilla Model Advantages:**
- ✅ **Consistent Performance**: Low variance across splits (±2.06% vs ±6.94%)
- ✅ **Fast Convergence**: Models learn quickly and effectively
- ✅ **Robust Architecture**: Simple design proves more reliable
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Faster training enables quicker iteration

**Enhanced Model Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **High Variance**: Inconsistent performance across splits
- ⚠️ **Slow Convergence**: Requires significantly more training time
- ⚠️ **Complexity Overhead**: Advanced features don't translate to better performance

## 🚨 Critical Discovery: Preprocessing Bug Impact

Both models suffer from **identical preprocessing bugs** in specific splits:

**Root Cause:**
- Encoder/scaler mismatch between training and inference
- Training: Used fitted encoders from training data distribution
- Inference: Created new encoders from 2023 data (different distribution)

**Impact:**
- Splits 3 & 5: 1300%+ MAPE (complete failure)
- Splits 1, 2, 4: Normal performance degradation patterns

**Solution Applied to Enhanced Model:**
- Fixed preprocessing reduced Enhanced Model from 74% → 30% MAPE
- Same fix would likely improve Vanilla Model Splits 3 & 5 dramatically

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### **1. Production Deployment Strategy**

**Immediate Action:**
- ✅ **Deploy Vanilla Model Split 4** (11.51% MAPE) for production use
- ✅ Use Vanilla Model Split 2 as backup (16.45% MAPE)
