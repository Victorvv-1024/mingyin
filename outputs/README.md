## Experiment Naming

Outputs are organized by timestamp: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

Example: `outputs/20250616_120000/models/enhanced_embedding_model_fold_1.keras`

## Model Performance

- **Vanilla Model**: ~18-22% MAPE (baseline comparison)
- **Enhanced Model**: ~14-18% MAPE (production deployment)

## Note

Model files (.keras) are not included in git due to size constraints (>100MB each). Run the training pipeline to generate models locally.
